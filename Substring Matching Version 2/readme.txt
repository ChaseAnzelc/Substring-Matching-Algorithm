ASSIGNMENT 1B

PROJECT INFORMATION
In this assignment I created 2 functions 
ReadData(filename) and BuildDFA(pattern). The ReadData 
reads the input from the file and extracts the pattern and text. 
The BuildDFA creates a DFA for the pattern from the file.

HOW TO DOWNLOAD FROM BLACKBOARD

1.Download the Assignment1B.zip from blackboard to your desktop.
2.Unzip the Assignment1B.zip to the desktop.


HOW TO COMPILE
1. open the command prompt
2. type "cd Desktop" to change directory to the desktop 
3. type "cd Assignment1B\Assignment1B" to change directory to the Assignment1B folder
4. then type "javac SubstringMatching.java"

//if you want to download to a different location just change directories to that 
location instead and then run line 4


HOW TO RUN
1. type "java SubstringMatching test1.txt" to run the program for test 1
2. type "java SubstringMatching test2.txt" to run the program for test 2
3. type "java SubstringMatching test3.txt" to run the program for test 3
